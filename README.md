# WorkShopDev-2020
Description of the idea:

The site is called "Casa criativa", it's purpose is to list ideas to do at your free time. It was made during the difficult time of the Corona Virus (COVID-19). 

--------------------------------------------------------------Code talking---------------------------------------------------------------- 
Code made in the WorckShopDev week on 2020.
Some of the technologies used:
   
   Node js
   Nunjucks
   Nodemon
   Sqlite3
   
Now finished by the ideas made during the week, the code isn't the same as the teacher made. I did some things myself, 
an in near future I will update it to add some functionalities that couldn't be made durring the week.
What I have in mind today is: Add fucntion to delete an idea(already have the button made and the function call);
A user stucture to log in with different acconts.
