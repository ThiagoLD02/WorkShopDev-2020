# WorkShopDev-2020

<h2>Description of the idea:</h2>
<p>The site is called "Casa criativa", it's purpose is to list ideas to do at your free time. It was made during the difficult time of 
Corona Virus (COVID-19). </p> 

--------------------------------------------------------------Code talking--------------------------------------------------------------
<p>
Code made in the WorckShopDev week on 2020.
Some of the technologies used:
</p>

<li>Node js</li>
<li>Nunjucks</li>
<li>Nodemon</li>
<li>Sqlite3</li>  
   
</br>
   


<p>
Now finished by the ideas made during the week, the code isn't the same as the teacher made. I did some things myself, 
an in near future I will update it to add some functionalities that couldn't be made durring the week.
What I have in mind today is: Add fucntion to delete an idea(already have the button made and the function call);
A user stucture to log in with different acconts.
